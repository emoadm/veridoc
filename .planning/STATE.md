# VeriDoc AI — Project State

Project memory. Updated as work progresses.

## Project Reference

- **Core value:** AI-powered SDV — a fleet of specialized agents verifies EMR source
  data against Medidata Rave eCRF data, with ALCOA+ assessment, prioritized
  discrepancy queries, and a tamper-evident audit trail. Decision-support only
  (mandatory human-in-the-loop).

- **Current milestone:** Milestone 1 — Buildable Phase-1 Core.
- **Milestone success metric:** Synthetic FHIR R4 + Rave mock in → prioritized
  discrepancy queries + ALCOA+ assessment + complete tamper-evident audit trail out,
  verifiable end-to-end against fixtures.

- **Current focus:** Roadmap approved/initialized; ready to plan Phase 1.

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 — Platform Skeleton & Audit Foundation (not started)
- **Plan:** none yet
- **Status:** Roadmap created; awaiting `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- **Progress:** Phase 0/8 complete
  `[________] 0%`

## Performance Metrics

- Phases complete: 0/8
- Requirements mapped: 16/16 (100%)
- Orphaned requirements: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Locked decisions

- DEC-fhir-r4-canonical — FHIR R4 is the canonical internal patient model.
- DEC-rave-primary-ecrf — Medidata Rave (MDRWS) is the primary eCRF.
- DEC-human-in-the-loop — mandatory human review for ALL clinical decisions; binding
  architectural constraint.

- DEC-gamp5-csv — GAMP 5 CSV lifecycle; validation-ready docs throughout; IQ/OQ/PQ
  gates *commercial* deployment.

- DEC-regional-data-residency — regional cloud residency designed in from day one.

### Open decisions

- DEC-cloud-provider — AWS vs Azure UNDECIDED. Keep IaC provider-portable until decided.

### Parallel constraints (track, do not block phases)

- CON-regulatory-strategy-first — RA strategy + CSV plan (runs in parallel).
- CON-medidata-partner — production Rave access gated on partner status; this
  milestone uses a Rave **mock** behind an abstraction layer.

- CON-iq-oq-pq-validation / CON-gamp5-csv — PQ + production access gate COMMERCIAL
  deployment, not build start.

- CON-pilot-partner — pilot CRO/Sponsor engagement (business prerequisite, non-blocking).

### Binding standards

- Coding: SNOMED CT, MedDRA, LOINC, CTCAE v5.0, ATC/WHO Drug Dictionary.
- Audit trail: immutable, 15-year retention, captures agent decisions + confidence.
- Security: 21 CFR Part 11 / Annex 11 / GDPR / HIPAA baseline from day one.

### Todos / watch items

- Phase 3 (Rave) and Phase 2 (EMR) both depend only on Phase 1 — can be planned in
  either order; Phase 4 needs both.

- Build Rave abstraction layer cleanly so mock → production swap is trivial when
  CON-medidata-partner clears.

### Blockers

- None.

## Session Continuity

- **Last action:** gsd-roadmapper created PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md,
  STATE.md from ingested PRD intel (new-project-from-ingest).

- **Next action:** `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
